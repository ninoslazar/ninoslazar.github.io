                    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your recent application at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
                    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
                                                <p>We are <em>happy</em> to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the begninning of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please let me knowif this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
                    <p>You can find more information about <a href=http://example.com>important univeristy dates</a> on our website.</p>
                    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
                                                <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty <strong>open-minded</strong> research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher. Just the kind of person we'd love to have on our team. On this note, of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the ones that follow, in order of priority:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</me>.</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF). When the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup></m></met>).</li>
                    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
                    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
                    <dl>
                    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                    <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. A whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
                    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they would practice this dance, which would involve huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he though this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements being practiced by inhabitants of Northers Alaska and Canada. Later on, however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
                    </dl>
